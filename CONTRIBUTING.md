# Contributions
## Discord
#### Interested in contributing to the development of Bot Evan? We would love to have you! Most of Evan's development is discussed through our [discord server](https://discord.gg/pC5Dmqg). After joining the server you can ask for a bot role and an admin will give it to you so you will be able to view the bot related areas. Additionally you can directly message me `Chien Dr√¥le#3451`.
## Github
#### If you do not like discord or simply prefer not to use it, you can always make [Issues](https://github.com/xonmello/rlbot-evan/issues) or other suggestions on here. This is not the preferred way of doing things but it will be noticed if this is what you choose.
